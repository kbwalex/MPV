MAZE PROJECT: PROJECT REPORT (WEEK 2)
PROGRESS
On a scale 1 to 10, I would rate my progress so far at a 5 because I have been able to achieve only about half of what I outlined on my Trello board, and only because I have decided to build upon someone’s earlier but rudimentary work.

Unfortunately, I have been able to achieve very little of what I had hoped to achieve. The complexity of my project was compounded by the fact that almost every reference material on the issue is exceedingly outdated, or inaccurate, or inadequate, or extremely difficult to understand.

However, as stated earlier, from this point forward I intend to build upon a basic maze built by someone else with all the basic features implemented (movement, rendering wall, rotation).

Incomplete features include: rendering the floor and ceiling, and implementing a minimap of the maze that indicates the player’s current position, direction and FOV.
CHALLENGES
My most difficult technical challenge is the concept of raycasting. After going through countless tutorials and articles on the subject matter, I still do not fully understand how it works, let alone to write code for it. As stated in the section before this one, materials on the concept are either very old, inaccurate, poorly written; with good ones being very hard to come by in general.
The mathematics involved is also quite complicated and, at times, intimidating.

My most difficult technical challenge would be the availability of time. I have been awfully busy lately, with a lot of urgent engagements taking my time. Finding time to build my project has proved to be a real hassle.
